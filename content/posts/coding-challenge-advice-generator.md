I've started doing Coding Challenges on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), it's a great opportunity for me to try out new things, from freshly baked Vue updates to new frameworks entirely like Astro or Svelte.

Frontend Mentor is great because the challenges have detailed briefs with acceptance criteria, extra bonus tasks and great designs. They even give you Figma files, complete with a design system for the project, so you can build to the design and be pixel-perfect. The Advice Generator challenge was a nice simple app to start off with, hitting a single endpoint from the Advice Slip API to give a random piece of advice every time you refresh the page or click the re-roll button.
