I've always wanted to build a quiz app - a bunch of questions and answers integrated into a nice design. Frontend Mentor has a great coding challenge for this, with subjects covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Accessibility. Users can select a subject, select an answer from the available options and see if the answer was correct or not. There are 10 questions per subject in the quiz and the user is presented with a results page at the end with their final score.
