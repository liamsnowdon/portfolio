For the second coding challenge I wanted to pick up a more advanced challenge which would include more responsive component building, working with forms and user input and multiple pages.

The Devjobs challenge consists of a job posting board for developer and engineering jobs. It has a paginated list of job posts coming from a Nuxt API route and can be filtered by job title, company name, location and full time only jobs. Clicking through to the job post takes the user to the job details page which has the job description details including requirements and the role.

To top it all off, it has a colour mode switcher to change between light and dark mode, using the system default initially.
