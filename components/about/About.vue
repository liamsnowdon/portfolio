          I'm a frontend engineer with over {{ experience }} years of commercial experience in web development. My journey started with AngularJS and jQuery, but I quickly fell in love with the simplicity and ease of use of Vue.js and Nuxt.js.
        </p>

        <p text="lg neutral-400">
          I've worked on a wide variety of projects, ranging from small static websites to large-scale enterprise applications. I have a keen eye for detail and am passionate about delivering high-quality and pixel-perfect designs.

          When I'm not building cool stuff, I'm an avid video game achievement hunter. I love collecting all achievements and 100%-ing as many games as I can.
