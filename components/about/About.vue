        <p text="lg neutral-400">
          I'm a frontend engineer with over 6 years of commercial experience in web development. My journey started with AngularJS and jQuery, but I quickly fell in love with the simplicity and ease of use of Vue.js.
        </p>

        <p text="lg neutral-400">
          Over the years, I have worked on a wide variety of projects, ranging from small static websites to large-scale enterprise applications. I have a keen eye for detail and am passionate about delivering high-quality and pixel-perfect designs.

          When I'm not building cool stuff, I enjoy video games... like a LOT. Considering the amount of time I've sunk into Overwatch I should be way better at the game, but I'm still having fun so who's the real winner here? ðŸ˜‰
